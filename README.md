# ToDo Web App
## A website for keeping track of what you need to do
If you need a free place to keep track of your to-do list, look no further.

#### TO-DO NEXT
- refactor New Task and New Project buttons to work with contentEditable divs
- fix this godforsaken bug that makes it so, on iOS, pressing "New Task" creates a new task element and gives it focus, but the keyboard doesn't pop up
  - on subsequent presses of New Task, the keyboard DOES pop up, but ONLY if there is already a task with the same name as the placeholder task name
  - FocusEvent fires twice if New Task placeholder name is unique, triggering _handleEditBoxFocus() twice
  - the other task(s) with identical name(s) do not need to be immediately before the new task
  - the FocusEvent attributes in the console should have relatedTarget: button.new-item-button, but the extra Event's relatedTarget is null
  - doesn't matter what the identically-named task is (as in, the issue is not related to creating a task with the same placeholder name that the listener checks for to delete or repopulate when a user is typing)
  - the focus/keyboard functions correctly even when no other identically-named task exists IF another task name has accidentally allowed an "enter" line break to occur...?
  - confirmed the textContent in the newly-created Task Name derives from the task.name property, it's not going too fast and using the placeholder for empty task names

#### TO-DO LATER
##### Features
- add button on All Projects page to make "swap progress type" buttons dis/appear
- add option to delete project
- add "add sample tasks" button
- save everything in localStorage
- read localStorage upon loading page
##### Behavior
- make clicking away from mid-edit task name not switch to editing another task name
- add lastEdited property to project objects and, by default, sort projects page accordingly
- make text inputs start with shift key down using input[autocapitalize="on"]
- make New Task box have translucent placeholder text
- fix delete buttons maintaining hover behavior on iOS after clicking one
- fix checkboxes maintaining hover after tap
- implement "focusout" eventListener when editing name in a box (in view + viewTaskForm) for when iOS user presses "done" on keyboard - alternatively, just have every keystroke update the task name
- make it so General is not an option on Projects page
##### Style
- decide on style
- make footer tabs highlight active one
- fix placement of checkboxes relative to first line of task (maybe make height of checkbox match height of font?)
- get a + icon for the New Task button so it centers vertically
- get > and < icons for buttons
- adjust for desktop
##### Other
- should tasks get auto-added to taskArray?
- fix footer so it isn't too high if you switch to a page while the address bar is minimized NO LONGER SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM?
##### Maybe
- write a function to make adding testing projects and tasks faster
- make header remain in place even when focusing on name change input
