# ToDo Web App
## A website for keeping track of what you need to do
If you need a free place to keep track of your to-do list, look no further.

#### TO-DO NEXT
- write function to create Task Form

#### TO-DO LATER
##### Features
- add lastEdited property to project objects and, by default, sort projects page accordingly
- add options button for project pages
- add options button for Projects page
- add "delete all" button
- add "add sample tasks" button
- add "edit project name" option (but not from clicking title on Projects page as that should bring you to specific project page)
- save everything in localStorage
- read localStorage upon loading page
##### Behavior
- implement "focusout" eventListener when editing name in a box
- fix delete buttons maintaining hover behavior on iOS after clicking one
- fix checkboxes maintaining hover after tap
- add button up top that makes delete buttons appear!  maybe even replace "details" buttons?
- should tasks get auto-added to taskArray?
- fix footer so it isn't too high if you switch to a page while the address bar is minimized
- make header remain in place even when focusing on name change input
- make it so General is not an option on Projects page
- should each project have tasksComplete and tasksIncomplete properties so it doesn't have to constantly run the sorting algorithm?
- make it so New Task button doesn't cover buttons on tasks
##### Style
- decide on style
- fix placement of checkboxes relative to first line of task (maybe make height of checkbox match height of font?)
- get a + icon for the New Task button so it centers vertically
- New Item button should not cover delete buttons
##### Other
- isolate checkbox creation and task name/due date creation into their own functions
- would sortIncompleteTasks etc. work without compareAsc()/compareDesc()?
##### Maybe
- write a function to make adding testing projects and tasks faster
