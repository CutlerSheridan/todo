# ToDo Web App
## A website for keeping track of what you need to do
If you need a free place to keep track of your to-do list, look no further.

#### TO-DO NEXT
- make Back button in task form within logbook go back to logbook

#### TO-DO LATER
##### Features
- add checklist capability to task form page?
##### Behavior
- make it so pressing "done" on "new project" interface adds back the listeners so you can click through to projects; fix on task names too, if possible, though it works correctly with two taps instead of one when trying to click another name to edit it
- add lastEdited property to project objects and, by default, sort projects page accordingly
- make text inputs start with shift key down using input[autocapitalize="on"]
- make New Task box have translucent placeholder text
- fix delete buttons maintaining hover behavior on iOS after clicking one
- fix checkboxes maintaining hover after tap
##### Style
- decide on style
- make footer tabs highlight active one
- fix placement of checkboxes relative to first line of task (maybe make height of checkbox match height of font?)
- get a + icon for the New Task button so it centers vertically
- get > and < icons for buttons
- adjust for desktop
- stop delete button appearance on Projects page from changing the width of the progress bars
- add my name
- make project progresses same height
- make headers all same height
##### Other
- should tasks get auto-added to taskArray?
- fix footer so it isn't too high if you switch to a page while the address bar is minimized NO LONGER SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM?
- implement "focusout" eventListener when editing name in a box (in view + viewTaskForm) for when iOS user presses "done" on keyboard - alternatively, just have every keystroke update the task name FIXED ITSELF?
##### Maybe
- make header remain in place even when focusing on name change input

#### DONE
- *0.13.1*
- make progress of projects calculate correctly (currently says 0 for all)
  - is it checking before arrays get populated?
  - or actually addNewTask() isn't properly adding task to project because of how the arrays are repopulating; should try to pass the correct project into the addNewTask() argument in _repopulateTask()
  - the task.isComplete property is accurate; for some reason the _addTaskToProject() function isn't working
  - use toggleTaskCompletion in _repopulateTasks() if the property is isComplete and the value is true
- *0.13.0*
- add localStorage.setItem() for storedTaskArray and storedProjectArray
- move addTasksToProject() to test.js
- save everything in localStorage
- read localStorage upon loading page
- figure out why localStorage is emptying the storedTaskArray
  - it's happening during _repopulateProjects() because console.log() shows the array is full before that and at least as far as localStorage.removeItem();
  - it's happening during the forEach loop
  - it's happening during changeProperty()
  - it happens when changeProperty() tries to call localStorage.setItem("storedTaskArray");
  - ohhh it's because this is changing storedTaskArray before _repopulateTaskArray() is called, which requires the full storedTaskArray to work
- figure out why projects are repopulated but tasks aren't
  - oh I bet it's because it's not actually linking the new tasks with the same projects, they're just identical objects, so I need to save the indices of the projects
- import parseJSON from date-fns to parse the JSON date strings into Date objects
- add conditional in _repopulateTasks() to only assign date properties if the stored date is not null
- *0.12.1*
- create new "test" module
- move "clear all" to "test" module
- add "add sample tasks" button
- *0.12.0*
- add Clear All button
- fix create___() functions so, if a tab is clicked on from a task form page, the tab navigates the user correctly
- *0.11.3*
- add progress toggle button on each project element
- make progress toggle buttons work
- adjust progress toggle so it changes the project property
- prevent progress toggles from appearing on completed projects
- *0.11.2*
- add progress toggles toggle for Projects page
- *0.11.1*
- change project elements so project name and progress are in one container, delete button and progress toggle are separate
- fix complete projects not showing up in Projects
- make it so General is not an option on Projects page
- add another sample project
- fix New Project button so focus directs correctly
- *0.11.0*
- fix Delete buttons
- expand Delete buttons to delete projects too on Projects page
- add Delete buttons and toggle to Projects page
- make Delete Toggle revert upon switching to Projects page
- prevent Delete buttons on Projects page from opening a project
- *0.10.11*
- refactor New Project to use createEditBox() if possible
- adjust createEditBox() so clicking a project name in Projects creates the project page without the keyboard briefly popping up
- fix Projects page so, when you're typing in the name of a new project, you can tap another project name to focus out without it taking you to that other project's page
- *0.10.10*
- delete most of the _replaceProjectInputWithName() function because it calls _updateProjectList()
- fix this godforsaken bug that makes it so, on iOS, pressing "New Task" creates a new task element and gives it focus, but the keyboard doesn't pop up
  - on subsequent presses of New Task, the keyboard DOES pop up, but ONLY if there is already a task with the same name as the placeholder task name
  - the contentEditable div works fine on project names
  - FocusEvent fires twice if New Task placeholder name is unique, triggering _handleEditBoxFocus() twice
  - the other task(s) with identical name(s) do not need to be immediately before the new task
  - the FocusEvent attributes in the console should have relatedTarget: button.new-item-button, but the extra Event's relatedTarget is null
  - doesn't matter what the identically-named task is (as in, the issue is not related to creating a task with the same placeholder name that the listener checks for to delete or repopulate when a user is typing)
  - the focus/keyboard functions correctly even when no other identically-named task exists IF another task name has accidentally allowed an "enter" line break to occur...?
  - confirmed the textContent in the newly-created Task Name derives from the task.name property, it's not going too fast and using the placeholder for empty task names
  - if I use createEditBox() in _createProjectElement(), same issue occurs
  - the e.preventDefault() on the project name element is not what makes project names function fine
  - _submitTextValue() is getting called via click immediately upon pressing the New Item button
  -OH MY GOD.  This has to do with the "focus" and "click" events interrupting each other; setting the "focus" listener to {once: true} solves this, but then you can't edit a task name more than once.  PROGRESS
  - change "click" event to "mousedown"
  - curry _handleEditBoxFocus().  Somehow... somehow this fixed it.  Jesus Christ.  Three days on this.
- make clicking away from mid-edit task name not switch to editing another task name (also fixed thanks to previous bug fix)
